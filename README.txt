This assignment was to make a simulation of ants vs ant Lions. 
in the simulations ants can move up down left and right, ant lions can move in all directions.
if an Ant Lion moves onto an ant it will eat it. 
if the ant Lion goes too many turns without eating it will die. 
both creatures breed after a set number of turns. the simulation runs for 100 ticks and will pause. 

To start the simulation at start and pause press enter.
